# Code-Tools MCP Server Implementation and Testing - April 24, 2025

## Summary

This report documents the implementation of previously suggested improvements to the code-tools MCP server. I've implemented fixes for the tools identified as having issues and added new tools to enhance functionality.

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Fixed Update File Tool ✅

**Issue:** The update_file tool in the original suggestion file mentioned a parameter mismatch where the code expected `filePath` and `newContent`, but validation was checking for `path` and `file_text`.

**Investigation:** After examining the existing `file-tools.ts` file, I found that the update_file tool was actually already correctly implemented with the parameters `filePath` and `newContent`. There was no parameter mismatch in the current implementation. This suggests the issue may have been fixed in a previous update.

**Solution:** Since the implementation was already correct, no changes were needed. The fix suggested in the previous suggestions document was already applied.

### 2. Improved List Projects Tool ✅

**Issue:** The list_projects tool had permission issues when running from root directories.

**Implementation:** I've implemented an improved version of the list_projects tool with the following enhancements:

- Added optional `basePath` parameter to specify where to start the search
- Added `maxDepth` parameter to limit recursion depth
- if the mcp does not have persmission to access a directory then let the user know
- Added `ignoreErrors` parameter to skip directories with permission issues
- Added `verbose` parameter to provide detailed output
- Added `includeHidden` parameter to include hidden files and directories
- Added `exclude` parameter to exclude specific files or directories from the search
- Added `include` parameter to include only specific files or directories in the search
- Added `fileType` parameter to filter results by file type
- Added `recursive` parameter to control whether to search recursively
- Added `maxResults` parameter to limit the number of results returned
- Added more detailed output with project information

The modified tool now handles permission errors more gracefully and includes additional options for more flexible usage.

### 3. New File Conversion Tool ✅

**Implementation:** Added a new tool for converting between various file formats:

- JSON to YAML conversion
- YAML to JSON conversion
- Markdown to HTML conversion
- HTML to Markdown conversion

This tool enhances the file manipulation capabilities of the MCP server, making it more useful for developers working with different file formats.

### 4. New Template Generation Tool ✅

**Implementation:** Added a new tool for generating files from templates:

- React component template
- Node module template
- TypeScript class template
- Test file template

This tool simplifies the process of creating common file types with consistent structures, improving developer productivity.

## Testing Results

### 1. Update File Tool Testing

Tested the update_file tool and verified it works correctly. It properly accepts `filePath` and `newContent` parameters and successfully updates files.

### 2. Improved List Projects Tool Testing

Tested the improved list_projects tool with the following scenarios:

- Searching in the current directory
- Specifying a custom base path
- Setting a maximum depth
- Running on directories with permission issues

The tool now handles all these scenarios correctly, including gracefully handling permission errors that would have previously caused issues.

### 3. File Conversion Tool Testing

Tested the file_conversion tool with various file formats:

- JSON to YAML conversion
- YAML to JSON conversion
- Markdown to HTML conversion
- HTML to Markdown conversion

All conversions work as expected. The tool uses js-yaml for YAML operations, marked for Markdown to HTML, and turndown for HTML to Markdown.

### 4. Template Generation Tool Testing

Tested the template_tool with all provided templates:

- React component template
- Node module template
- TypeScript class template
- Test file template

All templates generate correctly with or without custom variables.

## Additional Tool Suggestions

In addition to the implemented tools, the following new tools would further enhance the MCP server:

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The implemented improvements have significantly enhanced the functionality of the code-tools MCP server:

1. **Fixed Tools**: The update_file tool was already working correctly, and the list_projects tool has been improved to handle permission issues.

2. **New Capabilities**: The addition of file conversion and template generation tools expands the server's utility for developers.

3. **Future Development**: The suggested additional tools would further enhance the server's capabilities, particularly for code analysis and project management.

4. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling across all tools makes the server more robust when dealing with edge cases.

I recommend continuing to expand the tool ecosystem with more specialized utilities for different aspects of development workflows, such as code analysis, formatting, and visualization tools.
