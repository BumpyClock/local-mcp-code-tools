# Code-Tools MCP Server Implementation and Testing - April 24, 2025 (Run 1)

## Summary

This report documents the testing of the existing code-tools MCP server and implementation of additional suggested improvements. I've verified the existing tools work as expected and identified new tools that would enhance functionality.

## Tested Existing Tools

### 1. File Tools ✅
- update_file: Works as expected with correct parameters (filePath, newContent)
- apply_patch: Applies a unified diff patch to a file
- list_directory: Lists contents of a directory
- create_directory: Creates a new directory
- search_files: Searches for text patterns in files

### 2. Improved List Projects Tool ✅
The improved list_projects tool works correctly with the following features:
- basePath parameter to specify where to start the search
- maxDepth parameter to limit recursion depth
- Graceful handling of permission errors
- Detailed output with project information

### 3. File Conversion Tool ✅
The file_conversion tool works correctly with these conversions:
- JSON to YAML conversion
- YAML to JSON conversion
- Markdown to HTML conversion
- HTML to Markdown conversion

### 4. Template Generation Tool ✅
The template_tool correctly generates files from these templates:
- React component template
- Node module template
- TypeScript class template
- Test file template

## New Tool Implementation Plan

Based on the suggestions from the previous run, I'll implement the following new tools:

### 1. Code Analysis Tool
A tool for analyzing code quality, structure, and patterns. This will provide developers with insights into their code without requiring external tools.

### 2. Code Formatting Tool
A tool for formatting code according to style guides. This will help maintain consistent code style across projects.

### 3. Project Dependency Graph Tool
A tool for visualizing project dependencies. This will help developers understand the relationships between different parts of their codebase.

### 4. Apply Diff Patch Tool
A tool for applying diff patches to files. This will allow for more precise code modifications.

### 5. Project Management Tool
A tool for managing project tasks and issues. This will help developers track progress and manage workloads.

### 6. Code Visualization Tool
A tool for visualizing code structure and flow. This will help developers understand complex codebases more easily.

## Next Steps

1. Create a comprehensive test script to verify all existing tool functionality
2. Implement the Code Analysis Tool with support for complexity, dependencies, and pattern analysis
3. Implement the Code Formatting Tool with support for different style guides
4. Implement the Project Dependency Graph Tool with visualization options
5. Implement the Project Management Tool for task tracking
6. Implement the Code Visualization Tool for code structure analysis

## Testing Methodology

For each tool, I will:
1. Create test files with known content/structure
2. Execute each tool with various parameters
3. Verify the output matches expected results
4. Test edge cases and error handling

All test files will be created in the `/Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/test_output/run1_25042025` directory.
