# Implementation Testing Guide

This document outlines how to manually test the fixes and improvements to the MCP server.

## Fixed Resources Implementation

To implement the fixed resources, you would need to:

1. Replace the existing file resource implementation in `/src/resources/file-resource.ts` with the fixed version in `/test/file-resource-fix.ts`
2. Replace the existing project resource implementation in `/src/resources/project-resource.ts` with the fixed version in `/test/project-resource-fix.ts`

## Testing Steps

1. Apply the fixed resources to your code base:
   ```bash
   cp /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/test/file-resource-fix.ts /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/src/resources/file-resource.ts
   cp /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/test/project-resource-fix.ts /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/src/resources/project-resource.ts
   ```

2. Rebuild the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Run the comprehensive test again:
   ```bash
   node /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/test/test-mcp.js
   ```

4. Verify that all tests pass, including the resource tests that were previously failing.

## Key Improvements

The key improvements in the fixed resources are:

1. Better URI handling with the `extractFilePath` and `extractProjectPath` helper functions
2. Support for the `path*` pattern in the resource templates to capture the full path
3. More robust path normalization and validation
4. Improved error messages with context
5. Better logging to aid in debugging
6. Cross-platform path handling

## Additional Tool Implementation 

The suggestions.md file includes detailed implementations for several additional tools that would enhance the functionality of the MCP server. To add these tools:

1. Create a new file in the `/src/tools` directory for each new tool category
2. Implement the tool functions as described in the suggestions.md file
3. Register these new tools in the `/src/tools/index.ts` file
4. Rebuild and test the implementation

## Testing New Functionality

After implementing the new tools, you can test them using a similar approach to the comprehensive test script:

1. Create test files and projects as needed for each tool
2. Create test cases for each new tool, following the pattern in the test-mcp.js file
3. Run the tests and verify that the new tools function correctly

## Deployment

Once all tests are passing, you can deploy the improved MCP server:

1. Update the version number in package.json
2. Create a new release
3. Publish to npm if applicable
4. Update any documentation to reflect the new and improved functionality
