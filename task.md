Source code is in /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/src
Suggestions file is in /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/suggestions.md

**You have access to mcp code-tools**. Use it to and other mcp tools you have access to for the rest of the tasks. If there is functionality missing that you would like and would make coding tasks for you and other LLMs easier, add it to the suggestions.md file. Use the file-diff tool to compare the code before and after your changes. This will help you understand what has changed and why. You can also use the file-diff tool to compare the code in the test_output/code_suggestions directory with the original code in the src directory. This will help you understand what has changed and why.

# Core objectives:

1. We are iterating on the code in the /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/src directory. The code is organized into different folders based on functionality.
   1.1 Test all the functionality exposed by the code-tools mcp.
   1.2 Document any errors that occur and think of solutions to add to the suggestions.md file.
2. We are implementing suggestions from the previous run and testing the functionality of the code-tools mcp.
3. We are creating a new directory under /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/test_output/ for all test content.
4. We are adding comments to the suggestions.md file explaining why we could or could not implement the suggestions.
5. We are testing all the functionality exposed by the code-tools mcp.
6. We are evaluating any errors that occur and thinking of solutions to add to the suggestions.md file.
7. We are thinking of any other tools that would have made this task more efficient and easier and adding these ideas to suggestions.md as well.
   1. We are adding a comment at the top of the file with the date and time we created it, and a brief description of what the code does.
8. We are iterating on the code in the /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/src directory and implementing suggestions from the previous run.

# Task: Code Review and Suggestions Implementation

## Objective:

The objective of this task is to review the code in the /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/src directory, implement suggestions from the previous run, and test the functionality of the code-tools mcp. The code is organized into different folders based on functionality. You will also be creating a new directory under /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/test_output/ for all test content.

## Instructions:

0. **Test the functionality of the code-tools mcp**: Test all the functionality exposed by the code-tools mcp. This includes testing all the tools and features available in the code-tools mcp. Do not create any new tools or features at this stage. The goal is to test the existing functionality and document any errors that occur. If you think of any other tools that would have made this task more efficient and easier, add these ideas to suggestions.md as well. You have access to code-tools mcp and other mcp tools. Use them to test the functionality of the code-tools mcp. Do not create test scripts. get the list of all the tools and features available in the code-tools mcp and test them one by one.
1. **Read the suggestions.md file**: This file contains suggestions from the previous run. Most of the suggestions are related to the code-tools mcp. If you can implement them, do so. If you cannot implement them, add a comment in the suggestions.md file explaining why.
2. **Move the suggestions.md file**: Move this file to the suggestion_history folder and rename it to suggestions_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md. This will help in keeping track of the suggestions made over time.
3. **Read the code in the /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/src directory**: This is the main code base for the project. The code is organized into different folders based on functionality.
4. **Implement the suggestions in the /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/test_output/code_suggestions directory**: This directory contains suggestions and code generated in the previous run, implement and test these.

   - Once you have implemented the suggestions, run the code and test it.
   - If the code is not working, add a comment in the suggestions.md file explaining why it is not working and what you would do to fix it.
   - If the code is working, add a comment in the suggestions.md file explaining how you tested it and what the results were. Delete the original file from the test_output/code_suggestions directory.

5. **Create a new directory under /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/test_output/**: If it does not exist, create a directory under /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/test_output/ for all test content. All test content should be created in this sub-directory only.
6. Rerun this 4 times. Keep track of the run you are on. The first run is run 1, the second run is run 2, and so on. After the fourth run, you will have a final report of all the changes made and the results of the tests.
7. **Document your changes**: For each run, document the changes made in the suggestions.md file. This will help in keeping track of the changes made over time.
8. **Add comments to the suggestions.md file**: Add comments to the suggestions.md file explaining why you could or could not implement the suggestions. This will help in keeping track of the changes made over time.
9. **Suggest any other tools that would have made this task more efficient and easier**: If you think of any other tools that would have made this task more efficient and easier, add these ideas to suggestions.md as well. This will help in keeping track of the changes made over time. Only think of of tools that would have made your previous tasks quicker , easier , efficient and better. Do not think of random ideas that are out of scope. For example, if you think of a tool to unzip and zip files but it is not a step in your previous tasks, do not add it to the suggestions.md file. If you think of a tool that would have made your previous tasks quicker, easier, efficient and better, add it to the suggestions.md file. For example, if you think of a tool to compare files and folders, add it to the suggestions.md file. If you think of a tool that would have made your previous tasks quicker, easier, efficient and better but is not related to the code-tools mcp, do not add it to the suggestions.md file. For example, if you think of a tool to compare files and folders but it is not related to the code-tools mcp, do not add it to the suggestions.md file.
10. **Add a comment at the top of the file**: Add a comment at the top of the file with the date and time you created it, and a brief description of what the code does. This will help in keeping track of the changes made over time.

## Tasks:

- Read suggestions.md file for suggestions from the previous run. Most of the suggestions are related to the code-tools mcp. If you can implement them, do so. If you cannot implement them, add a comment in the suggestions.md file explaining why.
  - Move this file to the suggestion_history folder and rename it to suggestions_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md. This will help in keeping track of the suggestions made over time.
- Read the code in the /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/src directory. This is the main code base for the project. The code is organized into different folders based on functionality.

- Implement the suggestions in the /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/test_output/code_suggestions directory.
  - Once you have implemented the suggestions, run the code and test it.
  - If the code is not working, add a comment in the suggestions.md file explaining why it is not working and what you would do to fix it.
  - If the code is working, add a comment in the suggestions.md file explaining how you tested it and what the results were. Delete the original file from the test_output/code_suggestions directory.
- If it does not exist, create a directory under /Users/adityasharma/Projects/local-mcp-code-tools/test_output/ all test content should be created in this sub directory only.
